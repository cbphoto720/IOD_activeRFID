# Radio Direction-Finding Antenna system
**Goals**
- long range direction detection of cobbles (rough initial cobble search)
- close range location detection of cobbles (<1m)
- low cost
- portable (handheld)

## Required materials
- [take inspiration from this picture](https://dl.cdn-anritsu.com/images/products/tm-ma2700a/handheld-interferencehunter-ma2700a-environmental-2.jpg)
I do have  a concern that mounting the toughbook to the antenna would be too heavy.
